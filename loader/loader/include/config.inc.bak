; BEWARE:
;   Please keep in mind that most of the following parameters change the code size.
; In particular, some settings also change code size for the loader's drive code
; (i.e. the protocol you choose and enabling the custom drive code API),
; but since a stock 1541/41-C/41-II/70/71 has only 2K of RAM, it might not be possible to
; run the loader with all the desired features enabled at the same time -
; try a different loader protocol or file system in this case.
;   If you need a loader of minimal resident size (in the computer's memory),
; set all parameters in the 'increase code size' section to 0,
; and those in the 'code size reduction' sections to non-0,
; set FILESYSTEM = FILESYSTEMS::TRACK_SECTOR,
